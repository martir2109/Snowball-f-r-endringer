<!-- ide nr 1 :
Increase the value for returning reusable bottles from 2 crowns to 10 crowns. This will get more people to pawn bottles and not throw them in nature. The idea is that the state pays more to get the plastic recycled.

            <p class="ideatwo"> Recycling in general is very important for the earth. By giving old stuff to organizations, such as to Fretex gives the things a second change to get used by somebody who will appreciate is. By recycling empty and used bottles helps to keep nature clean and healthy. Another reason why recycling bottles is important is that an empty bottle contains a lot of energy.
            <br>
                <br>
                By pledging bottles, it means that the boxes and bottles become new bottles, then reduces the use of raw materials, emissions and uses less energy in the production of new products.

            According to Infinitum.no: There is a NOK 2 deposit for cans and bottles that hold 0.5 liters or less, and a NOK 3 deposit for larger cans and bottles. <a href="https://infinitum.no/om-pantesystemet" > Pantesystemet - Hvordan fungerer det?</a>

            A lot of norwegians do not recycle their used plastic bottle. One of the reasons is that they do not get enough to get the will to go to the store to pawn it. Therefore can this idea to encourage people to pawn their used and empty bottles.
